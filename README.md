# Willhaben Webscraper

This project is a web scraper designed to extract data from Willhaben, the largest and most popular online marketplace in Austria. Willhaben offers a diverse range of goods and services, including but not limited to cars, apartments, furniture, electronics, and job listings.

The primary objective of this web scraper is to provide better insights into recent price increases in the cars market by extracting data from Willhaben. With the extracted data, it is possible to analyze various factors and gain a deeper understanding of the trends within the car market.




## How to get started?

2. After applying the filter, copy the URL and replace the TEST_URL in main.py with the URL you copied

3. Set the maximum number of pages to go through (to save time). You may also want to change the TAR_PATH or Header information. 
The Header indicates the type of web browser and operating system you are using. It provides this information to the web server so that it can optimize the content it delivers to your specific device and browser. To optimize your performance, you can replace it with your own Header. To find out your User-Agent information, simply visit http://www.whatsmyua.info/ or http://www.useragentstring.com/


4. Last but not least, just run the main.py file and get started with your project.
